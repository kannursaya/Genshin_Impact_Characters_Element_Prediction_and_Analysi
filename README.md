# Genshin Impact Characters Element Prediction and Analysis
This project uses machine learning to predict a characterâ€™s element or main role based on their in-game statistics. We analyzed the dataset, performed feature exploration and visualization, and trained a supervised ML model to classify each character accurately.
Features:

- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization

- Correlation analysis of stats with elements/roles

- Machine learning classification model (supervised learning)

- High-accuracy predictions on test data

Tech Stack:

- Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

- Scikit-learn

Use Cases:

- Game analytics and balancing

- Instant element/role detection from stats

- Character database automation
